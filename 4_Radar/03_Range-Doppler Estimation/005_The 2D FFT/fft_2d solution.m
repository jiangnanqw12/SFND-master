%% RANGE DOPPLER RESPONSE
% The 2D FFT implementation is already provided here. This will run a 2DFFT
% on the mixed signal (beat signal) output and generate a range doppler
% map.You will implement CFAR on the generated RDM

% Range Doppler Map Generation.

% The output of the 2D FFT is an image that has reponse in the range and
% doppler FFT bins. So, it is important to convert the axis from bin sizes
% to range and doppler based on their Max values.

Mix = reshape(Mix, [Nr, Nd]);

% 2D FFT using the FFT size for both dimensions.
sig_fft2 = fft2(Mix, Nr, Nd);

% Taking just one side of signal from Range dimension.
sig_fft2 = sig_fft2(1:Nr / 2, 1:Nd);
sig_fft2 = fftshift (sig_fft2);
RDM = abs(sig_fft2);
RDM = 10 * log10(RDM);

%use the surf function to plot the output of 2DFFT and to show axis in both
%dimensions
doppler_axis = linspace(-100, 100, Nd);
range_axis = linspace(-200, 200, Nr / 2) * ((Nr / 2) / 400);
figure, surf(doppler_axis, range_axis, RDM);
