%% RANGE MEASUREMENT


 % *%TODO* :
%reshape the vector into Nr*Nd array. Nr and Nd here would also define the size of
%Range and Doppler FFT respectively.
Mix = reshape(Mix, [Nr, Nd]);

 % *%TODO* :
%run the FFT on the beat signal along the range bins dimension (Nr) and
%normalize.
signal_fft = fft(Mix, Nr); 
L = Tchirp * Bsweep;

 % *%TODO* :
% Take the absolute value of FFT output
signal_fft = abs(signal_fft/L);

 % *%TODO* :
% Output of FFT is double sided signal, but we are interested in only one side of the spectrum.
% Hence we throw out half of the samples.
signal_fft = signal_fft(1:L/2+1);

 % *%TODO* :
 % plot FFT output

%% RANGE DOPPLER RESPONSE
% The 2D FFT implementation is already provided here. This will run a 2DFFT
% on the mixed signal (beat signal) output and generate a range doppler
% map.You will implement CFAR on the generated RDM


% Range Doppler Map Generation.


% The output of the 2D FFT is an image that has reponse in the range and
% doppler FFT bins. So, it is important to convert the axis from bin sizes
% to range and doppler based on their Max values.

Mix=reshape(Mix,[Nr,Nd]);

% 2D FFT using the FFT size for both dimensions.
sig_fft2 = fft2(Mix,Nr,Nd);

% Taking just one side of signal from Range dimension.
sig_fft2 = sig_fft2(1:Nr/2,1:Nd);
sig_fft2 = fftshift (sig_fft2);
RDM = abs(sig_fft2);

%use the surf function to plot the output of 2DFFT and to show axis in both
%dimensions

%% CFAR implementation

%Slide Window through the complete Range Doppler Map

%Select the number of Training Cells in both the dimensions.
Tr = 3;
Td = 12;

%Select the number of Guard Cells in both dimensions around the Cell under 
%test (CUT) for accurate estimation
Gr = 2;
Gd = 3;

% offset the threshold by SNR value in dB
offset = 22;

%Create a vector to store noise_level for each iteration on training cells
noise_level = zeros(1,1);


% *%TODO* :
%design a loop such that it slides the CUT across range doppler map by
%giving margins at the edges for Training and Guard Cells.
%For every iteration sum the signal level within all the training
%cells. To sum convert the value from logarithmic to linear using db2pow
%function. Average the summed values for all of the training
%cells used. After averaging convert it back to logarithimic using pow2db.
%Further add the offset to it to determine the threshold. Next, compare the
%signal under CUT with this threshold. If the CUT level > threshold assign
%it a value of 1, else equate it to 0.


   % Use RDM[x,y] as the matrix from the output of 2D FFT for implementing
   % CFAR
cellNum = (2*Tr+2*Gr+1)*(2*Td+2*Gd+1) - (2*Gr+1)*(2*Gd+1);
signalCFAR = zeros(Nr/2,Nd);

for i = 1:(Nr/2 - (2*Gr+2*Tr))
    for j = 1:(Nd - (2*Gd+2*Td))
        s1 = sum(db2pow(RDM(i:i+2*Tr+2*Gr, j:j+2*Td+2*Gd)),'all');
        s2 = sum(db2pow(RDM(i+Tr:i+Tr+2*Gr, j+Td:j+Td+2*Gd)),'all');    
        noiseLevel = s1 - s2;
        
        threshold = noiseLevel/cellNum;      
        threshold = db2pow(pow2db(threshold)) * offset;

        signal = db2pow(RDM(i+Tr+Gr, j+Td+Gd));
        if (signal <= threshold)
            signalCFAR(i+Tr+Gr,j+Td+Gd) = 0;
        else 
            signalCFAR(i+Tr+Gr,j+Td+Gd) = 1;
        end

    end
end


% *%TODO* :
% The process above will generate a thresholded block, which is smaller 
%than the Range Doppler Map as the CUT cannot be located at the edges of
%matrix. Hence,few cells will not be thresholded. To keep the map size same
% set those values to 0. 
 

% *%TODO* :
%display the CFAR output using the Surf function like we did for Range
%Doppler Response output.
