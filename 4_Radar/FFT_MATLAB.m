% Cosine Waves
% Compare cosine waves in the time domain and the frequency domain.
% Specify the parameters of a signal with a sampling frequency of 1kHz and a signal duration of 1 second.
Fs = 1000; % Sampling frequency
T = 1 / Fs; % Sampling period
L = 1000; % Length of signal
t = (0:L - 1) * T; % Time vector

% Create a matrix where each row represents a cosine wave with scaled frequency. The result, X, is a 3-by-1000 matrix. The first row has a wave frequency of 50, the second row has a wave frequency of 150, and the third row has a wave frequency of 300.
x1 = cos(2 * pi * 50 * t); % First row wave
x2 = cos(2 * pi * 150 * t); % Second row wave
x3 = cos(2 * pi * 300 * t); % Third row wave

X = [x1; x2; x3];

% Plot the first 100 entries from each row of X in a single figure in order and compare their frequencies.
for i = 1:3
    subplot(3, 1, i)
    plot(t(1:100), X(i, 1:100))
    title(['Row ', num2str(i), ' in the Time Domain'])
end

% For algorithm performance purposes, fft allows you to pad the input with trailing zeros. In this case, pad each row of X with zeros so that the length of each row is the next higher power of 2 from the current length. Define the new length using the nextpow2 function.
n = 2^nextpow2(L);

% Specify the dim argument to use fft along the rows of X, that is, for each signal.
dim = 2;

% Compute the Fourier transform of the signals.
Y = fft(X, n, dim);

% Calculate the double-sided spectrum and single-sided spectrum of each signal.
P2 = abs(Y / L);
P1 = P2(:, 1:n / 2 + 1);
P1(:, 2:end - 1) = 2 * P1(:, 2:end - 1);

% In the frequency domain, plot the single-sided amplitude spectrum for each row in a single figure.
for i = 1:3
    subplot(3, 1, i)
    plot(0:(Fs / n):(Fs / 2 - Fs / n), P1(i, 1:n / 2))
